# SALARY CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: 3 days_

This is an app to track employees in a database and budget for a salary. It will calculate the salary vs a cap (default 20,000) and if you exceed that budget, apply a visual indicator to let you know. The bottom will progressively fill up to show you how much of your monthly budget you are using up.

The search function will search your current inputs for a match or partial match. To clear, simply search nothing or input a new entry.
